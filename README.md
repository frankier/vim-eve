Basic syntax highlighting for use [with Eve](http://witheve.com/).

There is one option: `g:eve_highlight_markdown`. By default Markdown sections
will be highlighted as comments. You can set this option to highlight them as
Markdown. This isn't the default because it provides poor contrast between the
comments and the code. If someone knows a good way to get the best of both
worlds then I'm interested.

This is my first Vim syntax highlighting definition and is quite rudimentary.
Pull requests are welcomed.
